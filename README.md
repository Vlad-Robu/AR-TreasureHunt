Remember to allow the browser to access your device's camera.

# Usage
The web-app utilizes 3x3 barcode markers with values 1-8. \
Specific 3D scenes are tied to specific markers, so when the camera recognizes a marker, the web-app shows the 3D model on top of it. \
The last marker with value 8 requires completing a minigame before unlocking the last 3D model.  \
